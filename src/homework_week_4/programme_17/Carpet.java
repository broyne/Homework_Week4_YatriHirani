/**
 *
 * Carpet Cost Calculator
 *  * The Carpet Company has asked you to write an application that calculates the price of carpeting for
 *  * rectangular rooms. To calculate the price, you multiply the area of the floor (width times length) by
 *  * the price per square meter of carpet. For example, the area of the floor that is 12 meters long and 10
 *  * meters wide is 120 square meters. To cover the floor with a carpet that costs $8 per square meter
 *  * would cost $960.
 *
 * 2. Write a class with the name Carpet. The class needs one field (instance variable) with name cost of
 *  * type double.
 *  * The class needs to have one constructor with parameter cost of type double and it needs to initialize
 *  * the field.
 *  * In case the cost parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the cost field value to 0.
 *
